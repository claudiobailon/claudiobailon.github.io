# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

### The Problem Domain
The author has two suggestions to making programming easier. The first is:

Make the problem domain easier

This means is to break down the problem and understand the simplest part of it fully, then expand on it slowly. An example of this that he gave was in games.  The first level of a game is often very easy and allows you to learn how to play the game.  Then the game gets harder and introduced new things that build on your knowledge of how to play gradually. 

The second suggestion was to get better at understanding the problem domain.

This means that you should make sure you have a very good understanding of the problem before you try and solve it with code.  It is easy to try and start coding to solve a problem before you truly understand it, and doing so can be very time consuming.  I 

  
### Objects

* Objects group together a set of variables and funtions to creat a model of something you would recognize from the real world. Inan object, variables and functions take on new names.
* Variables become known as **_Properties_**. Properties tell us about the obejct.
* Functions become knows as **-Methods-**.  Methods represent takss that are associated with the object.
* Properties and methods have a name and a value. In an object, the name is called a **-Key-**.
* An object can't have two keys with the same name.
* The value of a property can be a string, number, boolean, array, or even another object.  
* The value of a methos is always a function.
  




### The DOM

| Element  | Description |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| \<b\> | Words wrapped in this tag make them appear bold  |
| \<i\>  | Words wrapped in this tag make them appear italic  |
| \<sup\> | This element is used to contain characters that should be superscript i.e. mathamatical exponents|
| \<sub\> | This element is used to contain characters that should be subscript i.e. foot notes or chemical formulas |
| \<hr\> | Creates a horizantal line  |
| \<blockquote\> | Used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Still must use <p> element |
| \<cite\> | used to indicate whre the citation is from, browsers will render contents in italic|
