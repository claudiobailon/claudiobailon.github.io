# Functional Programming 
 
  
## Overview
Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. This is important to building side-effect-free functions, so it's easier to maintain systems.  

## Pure Functions
A pure function has a strict definiton. To be pure, it has to return the same result given the same function and not cause any observable side effects.

## Immutability 
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
