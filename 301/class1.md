# Responsive Web Design 
 
  
## Overview

Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device
and every screen size, regardless of if it is on mobile or a desktop.  It is focused on providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone.  All users benefit from responsive websites. Responsive web design is broken down into three main components: flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media.  

Flexible layouts is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically  resizing to any width.  

Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles.  They provide the ability to specify different styles for different browsers and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation.  

Flexible media is vital to responsive web design.  As viewports begin to change size, media doesn't always follow.  Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable.
