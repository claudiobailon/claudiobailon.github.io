# Node.js
 
  
## Overview
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O  JavaScript runtime built on chrome's V8 JS engine. Basicallly, this means that Node.js is a program we can use to run JS on our computers.
Npm is the package manager for JS and is also the world's largest software registry. There are over 100,000 packages of JS code available to download.
Node.js lets us run JS on the server.  This has been tried before, but Node.js is the first to be popular.  Everything that happens in Node.js is a reaction to an event. For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it. If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request.
