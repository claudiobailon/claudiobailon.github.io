# EJS Partials
 
  
## Overview

Partials are useful when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Partials are like functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don't have to go and chage a piece of text in every page it appears in.  Instead, you define the reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.  

A common use for partials are for headers and footers.  Creating an ejs for both a header and footer, then connecting them with including them with the include call and filepath, allows them to be used.
