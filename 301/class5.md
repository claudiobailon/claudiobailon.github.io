# Heroku Deoployment
 
  
## Overview
I did the first two steps in prework, so I just had to finish "prepare the app", "deploy the app", and "logs".  The first two went pretty easily but I'm really not sure about the logs.  I ran the command and looked at my deployed site, but didn't see any changes. I'm looking forward to class tomorrow to clear things up.
