# Rest
 
  
## Overview
Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the Internet, then did a lot of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

That protocol is HTTP. It describes the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. Like GPS coordinates for information and knowledge. 

## REST
The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called "REST". REST procides a definition of a "resource" which is what those things point to.  A web page is a representation of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.  Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.  

Representations are something that doesn't get used a lot. Most resources have only a single representation. However, more and more new formats are popping up, such as web services or API's. The basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people.

This means that computers can use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.  This has been done before, but none of the techniques we use today work well when you need to be able to talk to all the machines in the entire world because they weren't designed to. So, we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.
