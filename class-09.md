# Forms and JS Events

### Events

Events are the browser's way of indicating when somethng has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button haas been clicked. Binding is the process of stting which element you are waiting for that event to happe upon.When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript funtion. When this funtion then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.  

Interactions create events ---> Events trigger code --> Code responds to Users

Types of Events include load, unload, error, resize, scroll, keydown, keyup, keypress, click, dbclick, etc..

  
### Forms

* Whenever you want to collect information from visitors, you will need a form, which lives inside a <\form> element
* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
* Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.
