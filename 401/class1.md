# Java Basics
 
  
## Overview
In Java, Every line of code that can actually run needs to be inside of a class.
declaring a class as public means that any other calss can access it
No all types are objects. It is built on top of basic variable types called primitives. 
## List of primatives:
byte (number, 1 byte)
short (number, 2 bytes)
int (number, 4 bytes)
long (number, 8 bytes)
float (float number, 4 bytes)
double (float number, 8 bytes)
char (a character, 2 bytes)
boolean (true or false, 1 byte)
## Conditional Operators:
int a = 4;
int b = 5;
boolean result;
result = a < b; // true
result = a > b; // false
result = a <= 4; // a smaller or equal to 4 - true
result = b >= 6; // b bigger or equal to 6 - false
result = a == b; // a equal to b - false
result = a != b; // a is not equal to b - true
result = a > b || a < b; // Logical or - true
result = 3 < a && a < 6; // Logical and - true
result = !result; // Logical not - false
you can use turnary in Java
