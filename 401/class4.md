# OOP
## Objects and Classes
### Objects
Objects consist of state and related behavior. An object stores its state in fields and exposes its behavior through methods. Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechinism for object-to-object communication.  Requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's memthods is knows as data encapsulation, and it is fundamental to object oriented programming.
### Class
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. 
## Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal Numbers
### Decimal
Decimal numbers are the numbers that we are use to, the base 10.  You start at 0 and go up to 9, but once you go beyond 9, it reverts back to 0 and you add a 1 next to it to make 10.
### Binary 
Binary numbers use a base of 2 instead of 10. So it only uses 0 and 1.  You start at 0 and go up to 1.  You're now out of digits, so you go back to 0 and at a 1 next to it to make 10, followed by 11, then 100.
### Hexadecimal 
Hexadecimal numbers are kind of odd.  They are the same as decimal numbers up to 9, but then they add the letters A-F, so a single Hexadecimal digit can hold 16 values.  So F is the same as the decimal 15 and 10 is the same as the decimal 16.
