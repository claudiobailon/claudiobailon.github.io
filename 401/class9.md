## A simple Java HTTP request

The HttpUrlConnection class allows us to perform basic HTTP requests without the use of any additional libraries. All the classes that are needed are contained in the java.net package.<br>

The HttpUrlConnection class is used for all types of requests by setting the requestMethod attribute to one of the values: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE.
