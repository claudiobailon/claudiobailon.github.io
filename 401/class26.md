# Serverless and Amplify
## Overview of Serverless
Serverless is a clod computing execution where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation 
and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, 
ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider. Pricing is based on the number of 
executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity. 

Most of the cloud providers have invested heavily in serverless, making it safe to assume that serverless will be 
one of the most used cloud services in the future.

Serverless takes management of the underlying servers out of your hands and into the hands of 
Cloud vendors.
