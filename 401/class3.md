# Maps, Primitives, File I/O
 
## Primatives vs Objects
Java has a two-fold system consisting of primitives (i.e. int, boolean) and reference types (i.e. Integer, Boolean). Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type. <br>
Every object contains a single value of the corresponding primitive type. 
## Scanning
Objects of type Scanner are useful for breaking down input into tokens and translating them according to their data types.<br> 
By default, a scanner uses white space to seperate tokens. 
## Exceptions
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an error ccurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object, called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.<br>
After a method throws an exception, the system attempts to find something to handle it. The set of possible methods is called a call stack.
