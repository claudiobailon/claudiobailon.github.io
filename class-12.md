#The Canvas Element

### Canvas basics
The canvas element is similar to an image element, but it doesn't have src or alt attributes.  The only attributes it has are width and height, which are both optional and can be set using DOM properties.  When height and weight are not set, the canvas will be initially set to 300 pixels by  150 pixels.  It can be sized by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit it's layout size. Unlike the img element, canvas requires a closing \</canvas> tag.
