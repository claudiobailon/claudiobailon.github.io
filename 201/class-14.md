### The Transform property
Elements can be transformed  on both a two-dimensional and three-dimensional plane.  2d transforms work on the x and y axes, while 3d works on x, y, and z axes.  The transform property in CSS accepts a handful of different values.  The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. A positive value will rotate an element clockwise, while a negative value will rotate it counter-clockwise.  The rotate value is taken in like this: "transform: rotate(90deg)"; this will rotate 90 degrees clockwise.

The scale value allows you to change the appeared size of an element.  1 is the default, values between .01 and .99 will make it smaller, and values greater than 1 will make it larger. It is implemented like this: "transform: scale(1.5)", which will make the element 1.5 times larger.  You can also scale just the width with scaleX, just the height with scaleY, or both with a normal scale but passing in the x scale factor first, followed by a comma and y scale factor. "transform: scale(.5, 1.5)" would bake the width shrink in half and the height grow 1.5 times.

You can move the position of an element with the translate value.  You can move the x or y position alone with translateX or translateY value, or both by passing in the x then the y.  The value can be passed in as both a pixel or percentage. Positive values will push an element down and to the right, while negative values do the opposite.   "transform: translate(-20px, 50%)" would move the element to the left 20 pixels and down half of the height of the element.

The skew value is used to distort an element on it x axis, y axis, or both, with similar syntax to the translate and scale values. The distance calculation of the skew value is measured in units of degrees, like the rotate value.   

You can combine values by listing the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas. " transform: rotate(25deg) scale(.75) skew(10deg, 20deg) translateX(20px)" would rotate an element 25 degrees clockwise, scale it down to 75% of it's size, skew it's x-axis 10 degrees and y axis 20 degrees, and moves it down 20 pixels.

### Google Teamwork
The bulk of moder work is becoming more and more team based.  Time spent collaborating has gone up by 50% in the last 20 years, and more that 75% of an employee's day is spent communicating with co-workers.  Groups also tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, and find better solutions to problems. Also,  people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. So, if a company wants to outpace their competitors,  it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together.

That's why Google's Project Aristotle sought to find out what makes a team work well together.  They concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Googleâ€™s teams. But the difficult part was that some team's norms were very different from anothers, while both found success.  They found two things at the heart of what made a team succesful. One, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion.  The times they talked varied, but what was important is that every member of the team had the opportunity to speak and spoke roughly the same amount as everyone else.  The most important thing, however, was psychological safety.

Psychological  safety is means feeling accepted and respected.  You feel safe to express your ideas witout fear of rejection and that your input matters. Nobody wants to put on a work face, they want to be themselves and feel like they are important to the group. In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
