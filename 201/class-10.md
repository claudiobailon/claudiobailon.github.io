# Error Handling and Debugging

### Summary
JavaScript can be tricky, and *everyone* makes mistakes when trying to write it. That's why there are built in error messages to
help you figure out what isn't going how it is suppose to.  
* Debugging is the process of finding erros. it involves a process of deduction.
* the console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try and find the exact error (which is really nice)
* JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
* You can use try, catch(exception), and finally to help you figure out what is failing. It's kind of like an if statement, but finally always runs.
