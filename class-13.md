* HTML5 Storage is actually a specification called Web Storage
* Web Storage was at one time part of HTML5 specification, but was split out to it's own specification
* Certain browser venders refer to it as "Local Storage" or "DOM Storage"
* HTML5 Storage is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser
* This data persists even after you leave the site
* This data is never transfered to a remote web server
* It is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not
