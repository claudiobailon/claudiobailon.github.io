### Intro to CSS notes

* CSS treats eash HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses *rules* to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of *selectors* (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and *declarations* (that indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* Declarations are made up of two parts: the **properties** of the element that you want to change, adn the **values** of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document using the /<link/> element, although they may appear within an HTML page using the <style> element.
* CSS rules cascade when two or more rules apply to the same element.  If two selectors are identical, the *latter* of the two will take precedence.  If one selector is more specific, the more *specific* rule will take precedence.  You can add !important after any propery value to indicate that it should take precedence.
